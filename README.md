# AWS S3 Backup Cost Optimization with Python (boto3)
AWS S3 Backup Cost Optimization with Python (boto3): Automatically Move Old Backups to Glacier & Send Notifications via SNS Using Lifecycle Policies

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b40b6158-970c-4014-8e39-352c2b0ff7bc)

# 📄 Project Description:
This project demonstrates how to automate backups from an on-premises server to Amazon S3 and optimize storage costs by moving older backups to Amazon S3 Glacier using Lifecycle Policies. The solution is built using Python (Boto3) for automation and Terraform for AWS infrastructure provisioning.

By compressing and uploading user and database directories to S3 and using AWS Lifecycle Policies, you can reduce your storage costs by up to 80%.

## On-Premise Server
   └──> [Database/User Directory] -> Convert to ZIP with Date Folders -> Python Boto3 Script -> Upload to S3 -> Lifecycle Policy: Auto Move to Glacier
## AWS Infrastructure:
   └──> IAM Access Keys -> Terraform Configuration -> S3 Bucket with Lifecycle Rules
## Automation Flow 
Local data → Compressed ZIPs → Uploaded via Python → AWS S3 → Glacier (via Policy)

# ✅ Features

🔐 Secure IAM access with Access & Secret Keys

📦 Compresses backup data into ZIP format with timestamps

☁️ Uploads ZIP files to Amazon S3

🔁 Automatically applies Lifecycle Policies to move files to Glacier

💵 Optimizes cost (Glacier ~$0.004/GB vs Standard ~$0.023/GB)

🛠️ Terraform-managed infrastructure

# Terraform AWS S3 Bucket with Lifecycle Policy Automation
- This repository uses Terraform to provision an AWS S3 bucket with automated lifecycle policies for cost-effective storage management.

### Explanation of the code (point by point):

## main.tf file 

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "6.0.0-beta3"
    }
  }
}

```

1 terraform { ... } Declares the start of the Terraform configuration block.

2 required_providers { ... } Specifies which providers are required for this Terraform project.

3 aws = { ... } Defines the AWS provider configuration.

4 source = "hashicorp/aws" Indicates that the AWS provider should be sourced from HashiCorp’s official provider registry.

5 version = "6.0.0-beta3" Specifies the exact version (6.0.0-beta3) of the AWS provider to use.

### Summary:
- This block ensures Terraform uses the specified version of the AWS provider from HashiCorp’s registry for managing AWS resources.

## s3bucket.tf file
```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = var.region
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example_bucket" {
  bucket        = var.bucket_name
  force_destroy = true

  tags = var.bucket_tags

  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = false
  }

          }
        }
      }
    ]
  })
}

```
### Explanation of the selected code (point by point)
- Lifecycle Rule Block (rule { ... }) Defines a lifecycle rule for the S3 bucket to manage object storage and cost.
- Transition to Glacier (transition { ... }) Moves current objects to the GLACIER storage class after 30 days to save costs.
- Noncurrent Version Transition (noncurrent_version_transition { ... }) Moves previous versions of objects (noncurrent versions) to GLACIER after 30 days.
- Noncurrent Version Expiration (noncurrent_version_expiration { ... }) Permanently deletes noncurrent object versions after 90 days.
- Status Enabled (status = "Enabled") Activates this lifecycle rule.
- Public Access Block Resource (aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block) Configures the S3 bucket’s public access settings.
- All Public Access Allowed All four settings (**block_public_acls, block_public_policy, ignore_public_acls, restrict_public_buckets**) are set to false, meaning public access is not restricted for this bucket.

## variable.tf file 
```hcl
variable "bucket_name" {
  description = "Name of the S3 bucket"
  type        = string
  default     = "burhandemotws"
}

variable "bucket_tags" {
  description = "Tags for the S3 bucket"
  type = map(string)
  default = {
    Name        = "BurhanDemoTWS"
    Environment = "Production"
  }
}

variable "region" {
  description = "AWS Region"
  type        = string
  default     = "us-east-1"
}

variable "notification_email" {
  description = "Email address to receive S3 notifications"
  type        = string
  default     = "job.khanburhan503@gmail.com"  # 👈 Yahan apna email daalein
}

```
### Explanation of the code (point by point)
- variable "bucket_name" { ... } <br/>
  1 Declares a variable for the S3 bucket name <br/>
  2 Sets a description for documentation <br/>
  3 Specifies the type as a string. <br/>
  4 Provides a default value: "burhandemotws". <br/>

- variable "bucket_tags" { ... } <br/>
  1 Declares a variable for S3 bucket tags <br/>
  2 Sets a description for documentation. <br/>
  3 Specifies the type as a map of strings. <br/>
  4 Provides default tags : Name = "BurhanDemoTWS" | Environment = "Production" <br/>

- variable "region" { ... } <br/>
  1 Declares a variable for the AWS region. <br/>
  2 Sets a description for documentation. <br/>
  3 Specifies the type as a string. <br/>
  4 Provides a default value: "us-east-1". <br/>

### Summary
- These variable blocks define configurable values for your Terraform project, making it easy to change the S3 bucket name, tags, and AWS region without modifying the main code.

## Output.tf File

```hcl
output "bucket_name" {
  description = "The name of the created S3 bucket"
  value       = aws_s3_bucket.example_bucket.id
}

output "region" {
  description = "The AWS region used"
  value       = var.region
}

output "sns_notification_email" {
  description = "SNS email address to receive S3 upload notifications"
  value       = var.notification_email
}
output "sns_topic_arn" {
  description = "ARN of the SNS topic for S3 notifications"
  value       = aws_sns_topic.s3_notifications.arn
}
```
## Standard Terraform Workflow
1 terraform init
- Initializes your working directory containing Terraform configuration files.
- Downloads required provider plugins and modules.
- Should be run first whenever you start with new Terraform code or clone existing code.

2 terraform plan
- Creates an execution plan showing what actions Terraform will take to achieve the desired state.
- Shows what resources will be created, modified, or destroyed.
- Does not make any actual changes to your infrastructure.
- Always review the plan before applying!

3 terraform apply
- Executes the actions proposed in the **terraform plan**.
- Actually creates/modifies/destroys infrastructure resources.
- Will prompt for confirmation unless run with **-auto-approve flag**

4 terraform destroy
- Destroys all resources managed by your Terraform configuration.
- Should be used carefully as it removes infrastructure.

## Example Workflow
```hcl
# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Review what will be created
terraform plan

# Apply the changes (after verifying the plan looks correct)
terraform apply

# When finished, to clean up (if desired)
terraform destroy
```
